My walk-in help hours start week 2. Note that you can bring a fellow student with you when you sign-up for a session. Just click the "Add Guests" link when you sign-up, and add in your fellow student's UP email. If you need more than 15 minutes, you can book at least two consecutive sessions.

### The Learning Commons$^*$

Students may receive academic assistance through Learning Commons tutoring services and workshops. The Co-Pilot peer tutoring program provides students with opportunities to work with other students to get help in writing, math, group projects, and many other courses. Schedule an appointment to meet with a Co-Pilot (tutor) by visiting the Learning Commons website ([www.up.edu/learningcommons](www.up.edu/learningcommons){target="_blank"}). Students can also meet with a Co-Pilot during drop-in hours. Check the Learning Commons website or stop by the Learning Commons in BC 163 to learn more about their services. Co-Pilots are a wonderful support along your academic journey.

### Math Resource Center

Appointment-based tutoring accepts appointments starting week 1 and sessions start week 2. Visit the [Math Resource Center](https://www.up.edu/learningcommons/tutoring-services/math-resource-center/index.html){target="_blank"} website to sign-up for an appointment. Drop-in tutoring is Monday to Thursday, 3:00 PM - 7:00 PM in BC 163 and starts week 2. Check the Math Resource Center website or drop by the center for more information.

### Help Hours Guidelines

It is strongly recommended that you attend the walk-in help hours or set up a one-to-one meeting with the me if you feel like you are falling behind during our in-person class activities, or if you just need to clarify concepts discussed in class. In order to be more productive during a one-to-one meeting (or the walk-in help hours), these are three recommendations before you come in:

  * List all gaps in knowledge you have (missed concepts) or list all concepts that were unclear to you during class. We will address them one by one.
  * Prepare questions you want answered and be ready to show relevant materials.
  * Regarding assignments, prepare to show (a) what are the steps you have tried and (b) what are the errors you encountered and the strategies you have tried.

Note that these are recommendations so that you can get the most out of the help hours allocated for you. If you just want to come in and chat about something else, feel free to do so. If the dedicated time for one-to-one meeting does not work for you, send me a message to set up an appointment.

### Collaboration Policy

I expect you to participate in the class through lectures, class activities, discussions, homework, and other engagements. I also expect you to make use of opportunities to get help outside of class (help hours, Teams, email, tutoring) if you need help. Concise and specific messages are the most helpful so I know how I can best help you.

> You are encouraged to participate in discussions with your peers regarding assignments. However, each student must take responsibility and ownership of their work and submit their work individually, except for group projects.

<br>

## **Assignments**

### Submission Guidelines

> You need to submit all assignments online through Moodle. Your assignments must be in a single `.pdf` file along with supplementary Python code (`.py` or `.ipynb`) if any.

Your work must be labeled correctly and clearly written. Homework, worksheets, and exams can be electronically hand-written or typed but must be uploaded to Moodle as a single `.pdf` file. Here are additional submission rules:

* If you choose to handwrite your answers on paper, scan your document using a scanner app to ensure the text is clear. I recommend using the "Adobe Scan" app, which is available for both Android and iOS.
* If the assignment involves a Python coding component, you must include all relevant Python code files (`.py` and `.ipynb`) that generated all outputs, plots, and analysis. Your Python code must be properly documented or with comments.

### Worksheets

There will be worksheets every class day except for exam weeks. The purpose of the worksheets is for in-class group work and activities.

> You must submit your worksheet individually by end-of-class or end-of-day. Your name must exist in your worksheet and the names of your collaborators.

Worksheets are marked mostly on completion, and partially on correctness. It will be marked either pass or fail, there will no detailed feedback on worksheets, and no opportunities for revisions and make-up.

### Homeworks

Homework is assigned every Monday. The purpose of the homework is to provide practice with problems, and it will include tasks that involve Python.

> You must submit your homework individually by the end of the day on Friday of the week it is assigned.

Homeworks are marked using the general grading guide and will be returned with detailed feedback.

* **Comply with the Course AI Policy:** Any use of AI tools must align with the course-specific AI guidelines provided. Misuse of AI will be considered a violation of academic integrity.
* **Adhere to Referencing and Citation Guidelines:** Properly cite all external sources used in your work to give appropriate credit and avoid plagiarism.
* **Uphold the Academic Honor Code:** I trust you to maintain the highest standards of honesty and integrity in your work.
* **Take Ownership of Your Work:** You must contribute meaningfully and be prepared to explain and defend your work.

### Code of Academic Integrity$^*$

The University of Portland is a diverse academic community of learners and scholars who are dedicated to freely sharing ideas and engaging in respectful discussion of those ideas to discover truth. Such pursuits require each person, whether student or faculty, to present truthfully our own ideas and give credit to others for the ideas that they generate. Thus, cheating on exams, copying another student’s assignment, including homework, or using the work of others without proper citation are some examples of violating academic integrity. 

Especially for written and oral assignments, students have an ethical responsibility to properly cite the authors of any books, articles, or other sources that they use. Students should expect to submit assignments to Turnitin, a database that ensures assignments are original work of the student submitting. Each discipline has guidelines for how to give appropriate credit, and instructors will communicate the specific guidelines for their discipline. The Clark Library also maintains a webpage that provides citation guidelines at [https://libguides.up.edu/cite](https://libguides.up.edu/cite){target="_blank_"}. 

The misuse of AI to shortcut course learning outcomes will be treated as a violation of academic integrity comparable to plagiarism or cheating. Faculty are responsible for including a written “Course AI Policy” in their syllabi that clearly states what they consider appropriate and inappropriate uses of AI in the context of their courses. Students are responsible for using AI in ways that do not detract from the established learning outcomes of the course. All members of the scholarly community are responsible for demonstrating sound judgment in discerning when and how to utilize AI in their work, upholding standards of citation, originality, and integrity.

### Course AI Policy

The use of generative AI —such as Copilot, Gemini, or ChatGPT— is encouraged and allowed in all of its capacity. However, students must use these tools ethically and responsibly. To use generative AI responsibly in this class, students should grasp underlying concepts, acknowledge AI's assistance, protect data privacy, verify information, and uphold academic honor code. AI should be seen as a learning aid, not a replacement for critical thinking.

### Ethics of Information$^*$

The University of Portland is a community dedicated to the investigation and discovery of processes for thinking ethically and encouraging the development of ethical reasoning in the formation of the whole person. Using information ethically, as an element in open and honest scholarly endeavors, involves moral reasoning to determine the right way to access, create, distribute, and employ information, including: considerations of intellectual property rights, fair use, information bias, censorship, and privacy. More information can be found in the Clark Library’s guide to the Ethical Use of Information at [libguides.up.edu/ethicaluse](https://libguides.up.edu/ethicaluse){target="_blank"}.

## **Other Expectations**

### Deadline Extensions

If you need more time to submit an assignment, you may request an extension by following these steps:

  * Communicate with me at least 12 hours before the deadline.
  * Specify the exact day you plan to submit your work or the number of extra days you need.
  * Please ensure that you adhere to the established timeline for submitting assignments, as it is important to maintain fairness and avoid over-reliance on extensions.

Submitting a few hours late is usually not a major issue, as long as I receive your work before I begin marking and providing feedback. An extension is not required in such cases. Extensions for in-class assignments --such as worksheets or activities-- will only be granted if I decide to extend the deadline for the entire class.

### Late Assignments

You are expected to turn in all completed assignments on time. Circumstances that may disallow you to turn in your work on time --such as a medical reason-- are understandable. Please let me know if you have missed the deadline way beyond its original posted date without prior communication regarding extensions. Because every assignment is an important aspect of your learning in this class, we will discuss when you will turn in the assignment as well as decide upon an acceptable consequence for your turning it in late. I am committed to successfully helping you learn from this course.

### Withdrawal Procedures

It is the student's responsibility to drop the course if he or she is no longer planning on attending the course or filling the other course requirements. In order to drop, the student must use and Add/Drop form available at the Registration Office. If a student does not properly withdraw from a course, he or she may receive an **F** for the course. A properly withdrawn student will receive a **W**. The last day to withdraw is **Monday, November 24th**.

### Appointment Cancellations

Please try to show-up to your scheduled appointments. You can cancel your appointments, but it is strongly recommended that you cancel 24 hours before your scheduled time so that other students can schedule when a spot opens. You can reschedule for a different day and time if you need to. If you have extenuating circumstances, please let me know as soon as possible to discuss next steps.

### Attendance and Participation

Attendance is not tracked. However, participation is highly recommended and often tracked through assignments and general behavior. You are expected to actively participate in this class. Participation includes coming to class on time, being prepared, being willing to ask questions and share ideas, setting up study groups outside of class, attending tutoring and help hour sessions, posting helpful resources online, and contributing to the discussion channels. Group and individual presentation of ideas is a suggested component of participation.

### Absences

Generally, students are expected to attend all class sessions according to the instructor’s direction. Students who feel unwell should not attend class in person. These students should inform their instructor as soon as possible.  Should the instructor need to miss class, the course may be temporarily conducted remotely. Should the instructor be unable to teach for an extended period of time, the respective department or unit will find a substitute to continue the course.

### Incompletes

An incomplete "I" will only be considered when the quality of a student's work is satisfactory (C- or better), but for some essential reason the course has not been completed by the student. An "I" is reserved for emergency situations only. To request an incomplete, the student must submit a typed, signed and dated letter stating the reason(s) why an incomplete is appropriate. The letter should also contain the conditions for the completion of work. Acceptance of the request shall be at the discretion of the instructor, Department Chair, and/or Dean of the College of Arts \& Sciences.

### Accessibility Statement$^*$

The University of Portland strives to make its courses and services fully accessible to all students. Students are encouraged to discuss with their instructors what might be most helpful in enabling them to meet the learning goals of the course. Students who experience a disability are encouraged to use the services of the Office for Accessible Education Services (AES), located in the Shepard Academic Resource Center (503-943-8985). **If you have an AES Accommodation Plan**, you should meet with your instructor to discuss how to implement your plan in this class. Requests for alternate location for exams and/or extended exam time should, where possible, be made two weeks in advance of an exam, and must be made at least one week in advance of an exam. Also, if applicable, you should meet with your instructor to discuss emergency medical information or how best to ensure your safe evacuation from the building in case of fire or other emergency. All information that students provide regarding disability or accommodation is confidential. All students are responsible for completing the required coursework and are held to the same evaluation standards specified in the course syllabus.

### Mental Health Statement$^*$

Anyone can experience problems with their mental health that interfere with academic experiences and negatively impact daily life. If you or someone you know experiences mental health challenges at UP, please contact the University of Portland Counseling Center ([https://www.up.edu/counseling/](https://www.up.edu/counseling/){target="_Blank"})  in the upper level of Orrico Hall (down the hill from Franz Hall and near Mehling Hall) at 503-943-7134 or hcc@up.edu. Their services are free and confidential. In addition, mental health consultation and support is available through the Pilot Helpline by calling 503-943-7134 and pressing 3.
